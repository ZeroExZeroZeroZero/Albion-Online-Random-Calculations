Yeah ahh Hi this is not going to be professional at all but here are some python scripts and what tiny little effort I can be bothered putting into writing these programs.

Both ways everything should do as the name says sorry the code is shit thats how its going to be forever because I am shit at coding and well everything else from here on out will just be me making progression when I get the time to make some.

Both ways feel free to do what ever you want with this and Ahhh have a good day.

If you wanna use these tools or what ever you want to call them just install python I used python 3 because why not.
here is a link if you wanna install it 
https://www.python.org/

once you have it installed just download the .py file you want to use and double click to run it.
if you have any issues with it ah try hit me up I should be on discord if Im not busy.
my discord name for the moment is : 0x000#2866

Also sidenote I know if this toolkit actually makes it further then the edge of me myself and I I guess someone will have an issue with the weapon damage calculator so if you are it is because you dont have a demofile.txt so either make one or download one for the moment I don't have any checks in place to make a new file so my suggestion is just to make a new folder put WeaponDamageCalc.py in there with the demofile.txt and then try run the file again if that doesn't work feel free to try and fix it your self or asking me.

Also if you actually know how to code im sorry your eyes had to see this and plz no bully for the shit methods I use to do calculations or the really bad commenting.
